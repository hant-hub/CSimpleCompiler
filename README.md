# CSimpleCompiler

# Compilation and Usage
Currently the project is in very early development
and parses hardcoded files. 

To Compile simply compile sb_build.c. Then run the resulting
executable in the project source directory. This will create a build
folder, compile_commands.json, and run the compiler.

Currently on Linux is supported.
